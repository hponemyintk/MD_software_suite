Collection of analysis codes for cation catalized electron transfer reactions--primarily focus on Ferri/Ferrocyanide redox pair. Some of the subroutines assume Ferri/Ferrocyanide pair as the redox centers by default (especially the subroutine related to vertical energy gap). Make sure to adjust the charge accrodingly when using this code for other redox pairs!
