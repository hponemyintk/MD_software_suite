This is supposed to be ultimate MD software collection for cation catalized electron transfer reactions--primarily focus on Ferri/Ferrocyanide redox pair. I will keep updating my old legacy softwares into this package until I have all the tools I need to do analysis in this one package. This should help me simplified a significant amount of data reading and writing tasks.

Right now the package can do MSD, and rdf well. It might currently have a bug in vacf, and that is the next thing on my to do list. Eventually, I will adapt my energy gap calculation code in this library too. The ultimate goal of this library is to serve as a swiss army knife for post-processing. Ideally, this should be the one script I would need to do all type of data analysis in a systematic manner!
